Assignment Policy for Contributors

Introduction
Welcome to our open-source project! We appreciate your interest in contributing. To maintain a smooth and efficient collaboration process, we have established this assignment policy. The policy is designed to ensure that contributors who claim issues are committed to actively working on them in a timely manner.

**Assignment Guidelines**
- Claim an Issue When Ready:
Contributors should only claim an issue when they are ready and able to actively work on it.
- Claiming an issue signifies a commitment to start working on it promptly.

**Active Engagement:**
- Once you claim an issue, engage actively in its discussion and provide regular updates on your progress.
- If you encounter challenges or need assistance, please communicate openly within the issue's comments.

**Timely Progress:**
Aim to make meaningful progress on the issue within a reasonable timeframe.
While the specific timeframe may vary depending on the issue's complexity, providing regular updates is essential.

**Unassignment of Inactive Contributors:**
- Inactive contributors may have their assignment removed from an issue to allow others to contribute.
- Inactivity may include failing to respond to comments or not making progress for an extended period.

**Review and Feedback:**
When you provide updates on the issue, be open to feedback and suggestions from maintainers and other contributors.
Incorporate feedback and iterate on your work accordingly.

**Communication is Key:**
Communication is vital to successful collaboration. If you are unable to work on an issue for any reason, please communicate this promptly.
Discuss the issue's status and your availability with maintainers and other contributors.

**Friendly and Collaborative Environment:**
We value a friendly and collaborative environment. Please maintain a positive and respectful tone in all interactions.

**Contribution Labels:**
Issues may be labeled with difficulty levels or suitable experience levels for contributors.
New contributors are encouraged to start with issues labeled as "beginner-friendly" or similar.

**Maintainer's Role**
Maintainers of this project are responsible for:

- Reviewing and assigning issues.
- Monitoring contributor activity.
- Providing assistance and guidance to contributors.
- Unassigning contributors when necessary based on the policy.

**Conclusion**
Our goal is to create a welcoming and efficient environment for all contributors. We believe that this assignment policy helps us achieve that goal by ensuring that claimed issues are actively addressed.
